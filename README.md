## problem
Download the Students Marks dataset from Kaggle. Build a linear regression model to predict a student’s mark based on their study time and number of courses they took. Compute the RMSE and _R_² score of the model both on the training and the test sets. Plot the residuals vs. the predicted values.

## Dataset
the dataset "Student_Marks.xls" contains columns: number_courses,  time_study, marks

## code
the code file "students_mark.ipynb" contains solution

## results
RESULT1 includes the metrics score: RMSE and R2 
residualplot1.png and residualplot2.png includes residual plots
