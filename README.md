Download the Students Marks dataset from Kaggle. Build a linear regression model to predict a student’s mark based on their study time and number of courses they took. Compute the RMSE and _R_² score of the model both on the training and the test sets. Plot the residuals vs. the predicted values. What can you learn from this plot on the data set?
